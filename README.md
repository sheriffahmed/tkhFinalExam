# Hello I am A.I. 

Unfortunately, your teacher has left me unfinished. I need you to finish me up. 
Please do not adjust what was written so far and do not push any changes to this repository. 
I need you to finish my Express Server and my Angular.js Application. 

Do not worry about designing. Worry about functionality more. 

### What has been done:

- Angular Routing 
- Names of the routes and their types
- The pages have also been set
- Controllers file has been made


### My server needs to: 

- Connect to my database
- Send data to the front end
- Create new Data in my database
- Update the current data in my database
- Delete data from my database


### My front end needs to:

- Show the data recieved from my server
- Send Post, Put, and Delete requests to my server to adjust the data
- Forms to Post and Update data


<b>PLEASE DO NOT ADJUST ANY OF THE FILES. ONLY ADD THE CODE INTO MY FILES.</b> 

## Before beginning to program this app, please look at everything first then find out where everything needs to be done. 

If you have any questions, you can try to reach my creator.
