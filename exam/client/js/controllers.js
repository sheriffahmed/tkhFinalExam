//Hello There friend, I need your help. Please write out the functionallity to get, write, update, and delete data. I know some of the routes have been written out. 
//Deleting and Updating should be by ID and after, I should be showing the get page. mainCtrl should also be empty. 
//To give you a hint, you have to make HTTP calls and I believe Angular has a module for that...I don't remember. 
//Please do not adjust the names of the controllers and the angular module. 


angular.module("examApp.controllers", [])
    .controller("mainCtrl", function($scope){})
    .controller("getCtrl", function(){

    })
    .controller("postCtrl", function(){

    })
    .controller("updateCtrl", function(){

    })
